# The last Android cleaner you will ever need!

## NOTICE!!! - December 13th (2020)
**In response to the large number of apps on the play store that are cloning Fulldive Cleaner and running ads, I will be changing from the MIT license, to GPLv3.**

**2020 has been crazy too. I have not in anyway worked on this app since the summer. But I'm back baby!**
